#### Guest Book
This application is a guest book of randomly generated guests which stay in a fictional hotel. Guests can have any information edited, be checked in or checked out or outright deleted. Information for each guest is stored in the MongoDB Atlas where client-side fetching populates and paginates the Guest Book Display making the entire app serverless! Next.js the main framework used for constructing components.

*Although there is Bootstrap like syntax all styles are custom made using Scss*

Poke around and add any fun changes to make this demo app suit your needs!
